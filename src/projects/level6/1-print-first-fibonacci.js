/**
 * Challenging!
 *
 * Create a function to output the first 10 numbers of the fibonacci sequence
 * Example
 *   fibonacci() // 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
 *
 * Background
 * The fibonacci sequence is created by adding the previous 2 numbers together to create the next
 * The sequence starts with `1 1` so the next number is 1+1=2
 * Now the sequence is `1 1 2` so the next number is 1+2=3
 * Now the sequence is `1 1 2 3` so the next number is 2+3=5
 * etc
